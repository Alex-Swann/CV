Over the past 6 years I have been working as a visual effects compositor working on films including Gravity, Harry Potter, Iron Man, and more. Additionally I have had experience working on commercials for advertising companies which include Nike, Addidas, Compare the Market and Unilever. My role comprised of adding effects to existing images and videos, creating a final product within a budgeted timeframe to meet the creative requirements of the director. It also had to meet the technical requirements of our clients too. Due to that I am already professionally familiar with what is needed when accessing how long it takes to tackle the problem of creating a product from beginning to end taking its delivery date into account.

More recently I have wanted to expand my horizons regarding learning and problem solving. Furthermore I have been looking for the opportunity to find a more structured career route which has led me to computer programming. Due to this, since February 2016, I have been learning to code and have currently just finished a 16 week course in web development at Makers Academy. Over the course of this time I have learnt how to enhance my problem solving skills, how to better my ability to self teach and updated my research skills. Initially for the first few months I was covering Ruby and since then I have been familiarising myself with Node.js and JavaScript. I've been working in teams of 6 on several open source projects all of which have been approached with Test Driven Development and have been pushed to my GitHub profile. Lastly, I've also gained the reputation of being a sneaky ping pong player.

At present I am looking for a developer role which provides opportunities to learn and grow in a fun and exciting environment.


## <a name="skills">Skills</a>


#### Problem solving

I have always loved tackling new challenges and seeking out new opportunities to learn. During my time as an account handler I managed various projects with tight timelines, such as delivering scientific events for 300 attendees within 3 weeks, and learned to apply this skill under pressure.

Since I joined Makers Academy my passion for problem solving has pushed me to research, read and experiment more to find solutions to problems that I came across during the course. In all of the projects I have worked on during Makers Academy, I found errors very intriguing, and I discovered that tackling errors and problems quickly became my favourite way of learning.

#### Mentoring

I believe that teaching is one of the best ways you can learn. I mentored for 2 years during my previous career in addition to working as a private tutor during my studies. I was quite excited to apply my mentoring skills to help another budding coder at Makers Academy. I really enjoyed sharing my knowledge on coding, answering questions and giving advice based on the recent experiences I had at Makers. Helping my mentee as well as others in the cohort made me realise how important it is to give back, and share knowledge to grow.

#### Working as a part of a team

During both my studies and career, I worked as part of both small and big teams. As an account manager I also led teams for over 3 years. The most successful projects I delivered were the result of great teamwork. At Makers, I really enjoyed being part of different project teams as well as coding as a pair. This gave me the opportunity to experience coding with people of different strengths, to work on XP values, and taught me to learn and grow with others. I really enjoyed discussing and tackling problems as a part of a team, as this showed me how individual talents feed into a successful project.


#### Organisation and time management

As a former scientist and account manager, one of the skills I am most proud of is to be organised, keeping to timelines as well as to budget. This skill has allowed me to target more realistic goals to achieve MVP during very short periods of time allocated for our projects at Makers.
